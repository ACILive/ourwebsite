<h3>About Us</h3>
<div style="max-height: 330px; height: auto; width: aotp; border: 0px solid #ccc; overflow: auto; ">
  <p>The idea of “ACI LIVE TV” was first founded in 2010-2011 school year, by five students that were taking ‘Web Publishing’<br> as a list three (grade 11) elective course. This group was discussing ideas for a group web project. The first project<br> was
    to make Facebook-like social web only for ACI. It was called ACI+ (ACI plus). Please note that Google+ started after<br> us!! This project was a failure. The group evaluated the project, reasons why a web project fails and they moved on. The<br> second
    web project idea was a Live TV channel for ACI. For the first time, ACI LIVE broadcasted Bazaar Day 2011 and it<br> turned out to be a great success. It received much positive feedback from all over the world from our graduates. Today<br> our channel
    has over 30 students which work with Apple, Canon, Livestream and more professional equipment. Our aim is to<br> share the activities which are held in our school with the ACI family and all over Turkey. The most important occasions<br> that we broadcast
    are Moods, Bazaar Day, Awards Day, Spring Day and commencements. ACI Live TV broadcasts English Drama<br> Night, Ekin Yazın activities and the graduation of our sister schools. Our broadcastings are published via Livestream which<br> is one of the
    most popular online broadcasting in the world through Facebook and our website. We are aiming to create new<br> projects every year. ACI News is one of the best examples. With all these qualities ACI Live TV is one of the first and<br> only high school
    live channel in Turkey.
